Introduction

In this project I am using algorithm exists in many variants which is commonly called Dijkstra's.Basically the algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.This projects helps us to deliver the products between two different cities by finding the shrtest path.
