Introduction

This project is being developed in C programming language. Project helps Students who want to learn programming get started with Data Structures with visualization, information and code. This projects helps us to deliver the products between two different cities by finding the shortest path.

Research

Features

In this project I am using algorithm exists in many variants which is commonly called Dijkstra's.Basically the algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.The common example in day to day life such as:-attending the event in different city,medical emergency,etc.

Benefits

1-A simpler way for students who want to learn Data Structures and algorithm.

2-Well organized way to learn.

3-User can find shortest path to reach out destination.

4-Saves user time.

5-Provides a better way for learning learn Data Structures by providing the execution and visualization features.
